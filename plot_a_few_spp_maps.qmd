## Pull all maps for several species

Let's pull all maps (historical + 3 future scenarios) for 1 species randomly selected from each taxon.  Examine maps to ensure same CRS/resolution etc.

```{r}
sample_maps <- list.files(here('lawler_spp_sample'), 
                          full.names = TRUE, recursive = TRUE, pattern = '.tif')
spp_df <- data.frame(f = sample_maps,
                     spp = basename(sample_maps) %>%
                       str_remove('(_gf85|_in85|_mc85|_bias).+') %>%
                       str_replace_all('_', ' '),
                     tax = basename(dirname(sample_maps)))

test_spp <- spp_df %>% 
  group_by(tax) %>% 
  slice_sample(n = 1) %>%
  select(-f) %>%
  left_join(spp_df) %>%
  mutate(scenario = case_when(str_detect(f, 'Historical') ~ 'historical',
                              TRUE ~ str_extract(f, '[a-z]{2}85bi70')),
         rast_name = paste(spp, scenario) %>% str_replace_all(' ', '_'))
```

### Rasterize and check CRS

```{r}
# spp_rs <- rast(test_spp$f)
### extents do not match - maybe historical vs future (based on file size)?

hist_spp_rasts <- rast(test_spp %>% filter(scenario == 'historical') %>% pull(f)) %>%
  setNames(test_spp %>% filter(scenario == 'historical') %>% pull(rast_name))
### ok, this rasterized successfully
future_spp_rasts <- rast(test_spp %>% filter(scenario != 'historical') %>% pull(f)) %>%
  setNames(test_spp %>% filter(scenario != 'historical') %>% pull(rast_name))
### as did these
```


### Loop over spp and plot maps

Not shown, for brevity - see final maps later in the script

```{r}
#| eval: false
spp <- test_spp$spp %>% unique()

for(s in spp) {
  ### s <- spp[1]
  spp_layers <- test_spp %>%
    filter(spp == s) %>%
    .$rast_name
  spp_future_rast <- future_spp_rasts[[spp_layers[1:3]]]
  spp_hist_rast <- hist_spp_rasts[[spp_layers[4]]]
  plot(spp_future_rast); plot(spp_hist_rast, main = spp_layers[4])
}
```

### Notes

It makes sense to include the full North and South America extents for the historical data, as these were probably used for the Maxent training.  And it makes sense to include just North America for the future scenarios, as the analyses were focused exclusively on the US.  But it makes it difficult to work with both map sets simultaneously.

## Crop the historical maps

Crop the historical maps to play well with the future maps...

```{r}
### Check info:
hist_spp_rasts
### WGS 84 lat-long, .0833 deg resolution, -180 to -30, -60 to 90

future_spp_rasts
### WGS 84 lat-long, .0833 deg resolution, -178.25 to -52.5833, 18.91667 to 83.1667

hist_crop <- crop(hist_spp_rasts, future_spp_rasts)

scenario_rasts <- c(hist_crop, future_spp_rasts)


spp <- test_spp$spp %>% unique()

for(s in spp) {
  ### s <- spp[1]
  spp_layers <- test_spp %>%
    filter(spp == s) %>%
    .$rast_name
  plot(scenario_rasts[[spp_layers]])
}
```
