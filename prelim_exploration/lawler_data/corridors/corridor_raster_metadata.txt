Abstract: The length of climate corridors (in km, if any) crossing individual planning units represented by 10-km x 10-km grid across the contiguous United States. The layer is a .tif file which can be opened as a raster layer. Raster values range from 0 (no climate corridors) to 92.5 km.  The original climate corridors were defined by McGuire et al. (2016), see Methods and Related Works.

Keyword(s): conservation planning, spatial conservation prioritization, connectivity, climate change

Methods: The climate corridors identified by McGuire et al. (2016) represent pathways that connect slightly warmer to slightly cooler areas (with climate data mapped at 1-km resolution) that were minimally impacted by human activities (as indicated by human footprint layers, Theobald (2013) and WCS (2005).  These corridors are shown in Fig. S3 in Lawler et al. (2019).  The length of the corridors intersecting each planning unit became the grid value for each cell in the corridor_raster layer.
